synopsis:       Hedsql examples and tests
description:
                Examples and tests of the Hedsql package.
                .
                The tests are located in this separate packages,
                because Hedsql is tested in two ways:
                1) against expected string values;
                2) directly against a database.
                .
                For the second kind of tests, we need connections with a
                database (better so!).
                It would not have make sense to request dependencies toward
                a particular DB package for Hedsql
                (as Hedsql prefers to stay DB package agnistic!)
                .
                Also, we didn't wanted to copy-paste the examples of
                queries between a "string" and "DB" test suite.
